# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-Using-Python-for-Sonar-
This project predicts underwater rocks vs mines using sonar data. It implements machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) with feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning, achieving 76%+ accuracy. Includes SHAP explainability to identify key sonar frequencies.
